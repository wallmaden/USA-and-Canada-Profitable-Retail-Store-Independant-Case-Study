# USA-and-Canada-Profitable-Retail-Store-Case-Study-with-python
This study analyses geographic distribution to identify key factors influencing profit margins across locations. Using exploratory data analysis, regression modelling, and geospatial insights, it uncovers patterns in store performance and regional profitability.

## Project Summary
This project was an independant case study. The focuses on analyzing profit margins across retail stores in the U.S. and Canada. The primary goal was to uncover trends in profitability, identify key factors influencing profit margins, and determine which regions performed best. Using Python and Excel, the analysis applied various techniques, including geospatial analysis, regression modeling, and clustering, to derive actionable business insights.

## Objectives
- Trend Analysis: Examine profit margin trends across retail stores in the U.S. and Canada to identify patterns over time.
- Correlation Analysis: Determine relationships between various business factors, such as discounts, sales volume, and profit margins.
- Geospatial Analysis: Identify the most and least profitable regions to uncover location-based profitability insights.

## Skills Demonstrated 
- **Data Processing & Cleaning**: Utilized Python for data wrangling, preprocessing, and handling missing values to ensure accuracy in analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted statistical summaries and visual inspections to uncover key patterns in profit margins.
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Mapped profitability across U.S. and Canadian regions using shapefiles and interactive mapping tools.
- **Statistical & Predictive Analysis**: Applied regression modeling and clustering techniques to identify key factors influencing profit margins.
- **Trend & Time-Series Analysis**: Analyzed historical profit trends to detect seasonal variations and long-term growth patterns.
- **Interactive Dashboard Development**: Created a Tableau dashboard to dynamically visualize insights and enhance data-driven decision-making.

- **Python**: Utilized Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visual analysis, and Scikit-learn for statistical modeling and clustering.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Leveraged Geopandas and Folium to visualize regional profit distribution across the U.S. and Canada.
- **Machine Learning & Statistical Methods**: Applied K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and StandardScaler for data normalization and pattern detection.
- **Excel**: Used for initial data organization, preprocessing, and basic analysis.
- **Tableau**: Designed an interactive dashboard to dynamically explore profitability insights and trends.
- **Development Environment**: Implemented in Jupyter Notebook within the Anaconda ecosystem for an efficient workflow.

## Dataset Information
### Source:
The dataset used in this project combines data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aditirai2607/super-market-dataset) sources:
  - **Sample Superstore:** This dataset provides a detailed information of a superstore’s operations, encompassing transactional data, customer segmentation, and return trends. It has been structured into three sheets—Orders, People, and Returns—offering a holistic view of retail dynamics. The inspiration behind this dataset lies in its potential to unlock actionable business insights, from sales analysis and customer behavior trends to return rate predictions and product performance evaluation. Designed to spark creativity and enable practical applications, this dataset is perfect for analysts, students, and data enthusiasts looking to dive into retail analytics and beyond.
  - **U.S. and Canada states:** JSON and GEOJSON files were used from Geoapify - Free GEOJSON Data (Website: https://www.geoapify.com/)
